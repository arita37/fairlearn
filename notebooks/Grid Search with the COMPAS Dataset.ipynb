    "This notebook demonstrates the use of the grid search algorithm from `fairlearn` on the [COMPAS dataset from ProPublica](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/propublica/compas-analysis/master/compas-scores-two-years.csv). This dataset comes from the criminal justice system, with the labels (0 or 1) representing the two-year recidivism rate, specifically whether or not a given offender is re-arrested within two years (with a 0 representing no arrest). Models based on this dataset are used in bail decisions."

    "Before we can try to reduce disparity, we must first ask what the relevant constraint on the disparity should be. There are two options currently in `fairlearn` - Demographic Parity and Equalized Odds. While `fairlearn` produce models which reduce violation of the specified constraint, that does not mean that the models are *fairer* in the broader societal context.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we use $A$ for the sensitive attribute, $Y$ for the true values and $\\hat{Y}$ for the predicted values. Since we have a binary classification problem, $Y , \\hat{Y} \\in \\{ 0, 1 \\}$.\n",

    "Demographic Parity requires that $P( \\hat{Y} | A ) = P(\\hat{Y})$. That is, each subgroup (African-Americans and Caucasians in this case) should be equally likely to get a positive prediction (which in this example means \"rearrested\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Equalized Odds requires that $P( \\hat{Y} | A, Y ) = P( \\hat{Y} | Y)$, which corresponds to two separate equations for the two possible values of $Y$. For the case $Y=1$, this is equivalent to equalizing the true positive rates (also known as \"Recall\") across groups. In the $Y=0$ case, this is equivalent to equalizing the false positive rates (also known as \"Fall-Out\") across groups.\n",

    "If we are using our model to make bail decisions, we want to minimise the number of offences commited when out on bail. We use the rearrest feature as a proxy for this (note that there are a number of issues with doing so). Demographic Parity does not make much sense in this case - what that will do is equalise the chances of predicting a rearrest. In contrast, Equalized Odds does - we will be aiming to predict a rearrest correctly at equal rates for African-Americans and Caucasians, and also predict rearrests which would not actually have occurred at equal rates."
